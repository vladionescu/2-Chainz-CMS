	<content><![CDATA[
		Throughout history and modern times, wizards and the lucky few have been blessed with their very own Patronus. These spirit animals are there in times of need and great strife. I've been looked down unto by the gods, and granted my own Patronus: a guiding light when the day turns to darkness. <br />2 CHAINZ is my spirit animal. 2 CHAINZ gives me strength, and courage.<br /><br />I opened this web-zine with hopes to insire you to find your own 2 CHAINZ. The editing, content, and philosophies expressed here are my guiding light for you.<br /><br />I hope to further the movement of CHAINZISM (a movement I've fathered) through words, lyrics, and haikus. Check back often for more inspiration, and let your Patronus shine through.
